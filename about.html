            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p> Masquerade started as a design experiment in a tiny studio apartment.
                I was frustrated with fast fashion and how quickly clothes felt “old”.
                Instead of buying more, I wanted a single piece that could keep changing
                with me.</p>

        <section id="about-mission">
            <h2>Our mission</h2>
            <p>Masquerade is about flexibility, creativity, and sustainability.
                Transformable pieces mean:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buying fewer items, but wearing them in more ways.   </li>
                <li>Expressing different sides of yourself with one wardrobe. </li>
                <li>Keeping clothing in use longer instead of throwing it away. </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <p>My name is Maya Ayyash, and I am a fashion and web design student.
            I am inspired by theater costumes, masks, and the idea that one person
            can play many roles. Masquerade is my way of bringing that concept
            into everyday clothing.</p>
